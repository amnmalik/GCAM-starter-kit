# GCAM-starter-list

List of tutorials/webpages/presentations/papers which are essential pre-requisite for knowing the very basic **conceptual underpinnings of IAMs** AND various **operational aspects of GCAM**. Note that the reading material here might be a bit arbitary, so don't worry if it doesn't immediately make sense to you or seems unstructured.

After watching the above videos and reading the material the list of things you should be able to do:
- [ ] Run GCAM, view the output on modelinterface, copy the results of one putput variable in excel
- [ ] Create one csv, change that CSV to XML, add that XML to the model run, see if that XML is correctly integrated into the model.
